# Schedule Builder

A modern Next.js app for generating conflict-free class schedules with a clean UI.

## About

This project was **inspired by the original scheduling algorithm** created by [Joud Alshehri](https://github.com/JAshehri/student_group_Generater).  
I built the **UI and Next.js frontend** on top of that idea, using Tailwind, shadcn/ui, and Vercel v0.

## Features
- 📅 Interactive weekly schedule display
- 🎨 Beautiful UI with Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- ⚡ Conflict-free schedule generation
- 🌐 Deployed on Vercel

## Acknowledgments
- Original scheduling logic by **Joud Alshehri**
- Next.js + UI implementation by **Fethi Ouerdane**
